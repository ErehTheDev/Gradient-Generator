# ðŸŽ¨ Gradient Generator

A stylish and interactive gradient generator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This tool lets you select two colors and a direction to instantly generate a CSS linear gradient â€” ideal for design inspiration and rapid prototyping.

## ðŸ“š About This Project

I built this project by following a detailed tutorial that explained the concepts of JavaScript interaction and dynamic CSS manipulation.  
Although it was quite challenging at first, especially some of the JavaScript logic I had never used before, the tutorial helped me understand each part deeply.

This experience significantly improved my ability to write JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM and handles real-time UI updates.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Two color pickers for custom gradient combinations
- Direction selector (top, left, right, bottom, diagonal)
- Real-time gradient preview
- Copyable CSS output for quick use
